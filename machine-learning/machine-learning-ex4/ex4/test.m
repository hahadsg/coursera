%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 4 Neural Network Learning

%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoidGradient.m
%     randInitializeWeights.m
%     nnCostFunction.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25;   % 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex4data1.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

% test
initial_Theta1 = randInitializeWeights(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size);
initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights(hidden_layer_size, num_labels);
initial_nn_params = [initial_Theta1(:) ; initial_Theta2(:)];
costFunction = nnCostFunction(initial_nn_params, ...
                                   input_layer_size, ...
                                   hidden_layer_size, ...
                                   num_labels, X(1,:), y(1,:), 0);
